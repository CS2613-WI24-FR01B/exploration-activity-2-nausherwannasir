# Pygame Overview

## 1. Which package/library did you select?
   - **Package/Library:** Pygame

## 2. What is the package/library?
   - **Purpose:** Pygame is a Python library used for creating 2D games. It provides functionalities for graphics rendering, sound playback, and user input handling.[2]
   - **How to use it:** Pygame can be installed using pip: `pip install pygame`. To use it in a Python program, you import it at the beginning of your script: `import pygame`.[1]

## 3. What are the functionalities of the package/library?
   - **Graphics:** Pygame allows you to create graphics, including basic shapes, images, and sprite handling for animated objects.[2]
   - **Sound:** It supports loading and playing sound files in various formats, allowing you to add sound effects and background music to your games.[2]
   - **Input Handling:** Pygame can detect and handle various types of user input, including keyboard, mouse, and joystick input.[2]
   - **Event Handling:** It provides a way to handle events such as user input, window events (like resizing or closing), and timer events.[2]
   - **Collision Detection:** Pygame includes functions for detecting collisions between game objects, which is essential for implementing game mechanics like collisions between characters or projectiles.[1]

## 4. When was it created?
   - Pygame was created in late 2000.[1]

## 5. Why did you select this package/library?
   - Recently I have been working on some gaming project for my personal interest and school work. I found out about pygame while working on other projects using Godot. Exploring this library made me appreciate the diversity of python and how powerful it is. It helped me with understanding basic of game development and made it easier for me to work in a GUI based environment.
 
## 6. How did learning the package/library influence your learning of the language?
   - Learning Pygame helped in understanding how to use Python for game development, which involves working with graphics, user input, and event handling. It also provided insights into organizing code for larger projects.

## 7. How was your overall experience with the package/library?
   - Overall, my experience with Pygame has been positive. It provides a straightforward way to create games in Python and has good documentation and community support. I would recommend it to anyone interested in game development using Python. It also provides a lot of basic functionalities that are easier to understand and makes you appreciate all the game developers out there.

   - **Recommendation:** I would recommend Pygame to anyone looking to develop 2D games in Python, whether they are beginners or experienced developers. It provides a solid foundation for game development and is well-suited for both learning and production projects.

   - **Continued Use:** I would continue using Pygame for future game development projects. Its ease of use and comprehensive features make it a valuable tool for creating games in Python. The built-in functions it provides gives you the essence of how games are made, collisions, physics, game-time/real-time, delta, frame-rates and so on.
