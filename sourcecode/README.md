\f0\fs24 \cf0 This program is a simple hockey game implemented using the Pygame library in Python. Here's a summary of what it does:\
\
1.  Initialization: It initializes Pygame, sets up the game window with a specified width and height, and sets the window caption.\
\
2.  Game Elements: It defines the colors, sizes, and speeds of the paddles and puck, as well as variables to keep track of the player and computer scores.\
\
3.  Game Loop: It enters a game loop that runs as long as the `running` variable is `True`.\
\
4.  Event Handling: Within the game loop, it checks for events such as quitting the game and handles them appropriately.\
\
5.  Player and Computer Paddle Movement: It allows the player to move their paddle up and down using the arrow keys and moves the computer paddle based on the puck's position (a simple AI).\
\
6.  Puck Movement: It updates the position of the puck based on its current speed.\
\
7.  Collision Detection: It checks for collisions between the puck and the walls, as well as between the puck and the paddles, and adjusts the puck's speed accordingly.\
\
8.  Score Tracking: It updates the scores when the puck goes out of bounds and resets the puck's position and speed.\
\
9.  Drawing: It draws the paddles, puck, and background on the screen.\
\
10. Frame Rate Limiting: It limits the frame rate of the game to 60 frames per second.}
